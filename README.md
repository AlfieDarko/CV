<hr></hr>
A full-stack developer & Makers Academy Fellowship student who produces visually appealing products using clean and concise code. I am comfortable with both front & back-end technologies and have experience with a range of database technologies.
I have a preference for front-end as it plays on my strengths relating to visual expression but I also enjoy working server-side too!.<br><br>

My previous career roles in events promotions & also starting up a property maintenance business has allowed me to develop my communication skills to a standard that combined with what I have learnt with software development, gives me a great foundation for a successful tech career.

##### Co-founder @ ClickCleanit (www.clickcleanit.com) (2017 - 2018)

* Successfully transitioned from cleaning to property maintenance & management in less than a year by identifying inter-related business.
* Built the business via cold approaching and pitching to potential clients. Communicating how we could improve their business through cost efficiency was key.
* Managed core team of staff with varying roles from domestic cleaners & removal men to inventory clerks
* Setup the website & Google AdWord campaigns. Doing this allowed me to grasp the basics of search engine marketing before outsourcing this task to professionals. I'm always willing to step outside my comfort zone to get the ball rolling.

## Skills

#### Independent Learner

* Implemented the facebook chat style messenger that displays online and offline status in that time.
* Comfortable with learning new tech and delivering working features under time-constraints
* https://github.com/AlfieDarko/acebook-byte-3

#### Business Awareness

* Having experience running a business allows me to recognise the little things that contribute to success.
* Coming from instances where losing even 1 customer would have a profound effect on our company's cashflow, I really understand how important great customer service and communication is. Developing User Stories at Makers Academy makes you assess design decisions from the point of view of the clients.

#### Creative Solutions

* Used Twilio (SMS API Service) for a Ruby based weekend project and immediately saw how I could adapt this for my business
* Building an SMS system that automatically messages sub-contractors essential job details as soon as they come in.
* Always alert for things that may aid a solution down the road.

#### Mentoring (helping others)

* Entered the Makers Academy Mentorship Programme mentoring 2 Makers students from their start.
* Writing medium articles catered to them on my experiences on the course (https://medium.com/@AlfieDarko)
* Regularly check in with them to see how they are doing on the course and if they have any concern
* Applying to be a Codebar coach after the Makers Academy to further build on this

## Current Interests

#### Music Production

* A great way of escapism while being productive and engaging my creative side. This is what got me into technology.

#### Restauranting

* (eating). A good way to build with people and blow off some steam. It's a morale booster.

#### Westworld

* HBO Produced TV show about artificial intelligence.
