## Recent Experience
##### Developer @ Makers Academy (Feb 2018 to May 2018)
  - Engaging soft skills whilst honing our technical craft. Pairing & groupwork taught me so much & it would be impossible to gain that knowledge by coding at home by myself.
  - Increasedly saw the importance of TDD from the first day until the last. In our bigger group porjects, TDD made us think more modularly about code and improved our overall code architecture.

##### Co-founder @ ClickCleanit (2017 - Now)
 - Successfully transitioned from cleaning to property maintainence & management in less than a year by identifying inter-related business.
 - Developed my soft skills by jumping in at the deep end. Cold approaching & pitching to new potential clients was scary at first but the lessons learnt were priceless.
 -

##### Events Promoter (2014-2016)
- Helped promote various club nights for students

- Sourced suppliers for ticket & leaflet printing
- Organising & employing ticket reps in uni student halls
