## Recent Experience
##### Developer @ Makers Academy (Feb 2018 to May 2018)
  - Engaging soft skills whilst honing our technical craft. Pairing & group-work taught me so much & it would be impossible to gain that knowledge by coding at home by myself.
  - Increasingly saw the importance of TDD from the first day until the last. In our bigger group projects, TDD made us think more modularly about code and improved our overall code architecture.
  - Adopted Agile, XP, SOLID & DRY principles and applied these throughout the 16 weeks spent developing our technical skills.

##### Co-founder @ ClickCleanit (2017 - Now)
 - Successfully transitioned from cleaning to property maintenance & management in less than a year by identifying inter-related business.
 - Developed my soft skills by jumping in at the deep end. Cold approaching & pitching to new potential clients was scary at first but the lessons learnt were priceless.
 - Setup the website & Google AdWord campaigns. Doing this allowed me to grasp the basics of search engine marketing before outsourcing this task to professionals. Being willing & able to do things outside of your comfort zone is essential!

##### Events Promoter (2014-2016)
- Helped promote various club nights for students
- Approaching Night Clubs, pitching event ideas
- Sourced suppliers for ticket & leaflet printing
- Organising & employing ticket reps in uni student halls

## Skills

#### Independent Learner

- For our facebook clone project, I had to get to grips with rails, ActionCable, Coffee-script & Redis in a few days.
- Implemented the facebook chat style messenger that displays online and offline status in that time.
- Comfortable with learning new tech and delivering working features under time-constraints
- https://github.com/AlfieDarko/acebook-byte-3

#### Business Awareness
 - Having experience running a business allows me to always see the business side of design decisions. Writing User Stories at Makers Academy in the planning stages of the development cycle made me hyper-aware of how important this is in software development too.
 - Coming from instances where losing even 1 customer would have a profound effect on our company's cashflow, I really understand how important great customer service and communication is.

#### Creative Solutions
 - Used Twilio (Customer SMS biz) for a weekend challenge project and immediately saw how I could adapt this for my business
 - Building an sms system that automatically messages sub-contractors essential job details as soon as they come in.
 - Automating this part of our business will help save time and cut down on discrepancies in regards to job details

#### Mentoring (helping others)

- Entered the Makers Academy Mentorship Programme mentoring 2 Makers students from their start.
- Writing medium articles catered to them on my experiences on the course (https://medium.com/@AlfieDarko)
- Regularly check in with them to see how they are doing on the course and if they have any concern


## Current Interests
#### Music Production
- A great way of escapism while being productive and engaging my creative side. This is what got me into technology.

#### Restauranting
- (eating). A good way to build with people and blow off some steam. It's a morale booster

#### Alternative Medicine
- I enjoy reading about alternative medicines for people with chronic illnesses and the legislative red tape & social arguments that stops people from getting the treatments they need
