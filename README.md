<hr></hr>
A full-stack developer & Makers Academy Fellowship student who produces visually appealing products using clean and concise code. I am comfortable with both front & back-end technologies and have experience with a range of database technologies.
I have a preference for front-end as it plays on my strengths relating to visual expression but I also enjoy working server-side too!.<br><br>

My previous career roles in events promotions & property maintenance has allowed me to develop my communication & management skills to a standard that combined with what I have learnt with software development, gives me a great foundation for a successful tech career.

## Skills

#### Communication

I have been able to develop strong communication skills at ClickServices by necessity. Being a small company, meant that I had to quickly develop the ability to sell, the ability to manage and communicate effectively with staff, contractors and clients. Juggling roles meant me and my business partners had to be expressive and transmit information back and forth frequently. This was one of the biggest accellerators for this skillset for me.

It also allowed to me to approach pair programming and team projects comfortably. I felt comfortable communicating ideas and general direction to my peers because I knew communication was neccesary for any successful team activity.

#### Client Centric

My previous experience has allowed me to identify ways to create a positive experience for customers and clients. Many of our customers had very specific demands in terms on the management of their properties and it was our duty to uphold this. No two jobs were ever the same.
<br><br>
We recently had to help manage a demo event for Moley Robotics ( AI Robotic Kitchen Assistant). Even though this was slightly outside of our business services, my previous experience in events promotions and our desire to please customers meant we were able to be of assistance.
<br><br>
I've used this client-centric approach when creating User Stories for a personal project. Being attentive to the detailed and specific needs of the the indended user can only aid in creating detailed spec & a fantastic product.

#### Problem Solving

I always make a note of useful things I think could solve another problem later down the line.
For our first weekend project, we had to use Twilio (SMS API Service) and I immediately thought about what problems this could solve at ClickServices.<br>
I set myself a side project to build an SMS system that automatically messages sub-contractors essential job details as soon as they come in.<br><br>
Keeping mental note of possible solutions has helped me immensly on the course. For our facebook project, we wanted to implement a live chat feature but had troubles coming up with a viable way to do so. I was able to implement an online chat feature using ActionCable, TurboLinks and Redis and implement a near faithful copy complete with online/offline status.

#### Helpful Team Member

At Makers, I enjoyed being someone in my cohort that people could reach out as often as they needed for coding assistance. I strongly believe you dont know something until you can teach it.<br>
This lead me to enter the Makers Academy Mentorship programme and taking on 2 Makers students.
I also supplumented my mentorship to them by writing medium articles on my previous experiences on the course.<br><br>
I am applying to be a CodeBar coach after I finish the course because helping people and giving back is important to me.
