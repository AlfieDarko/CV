## Alfie Darko

I like problem-solving and finding solutions. Looking for a role with exposure to lots of different technologies! (Especially React & Golang). An environment where continued progression is valued is one where I'd love to contribute towards.

Selected to be part of the Makers Academy Fellowship Program.

## Skills

#### Independent Learner

- For our fcebook clone project, got up to speed with rails, actioncable, coffeescrip & redis in a few days
- implemented a facebook chat style messenger that displays online and offline status.
- Comfortable with learning new tech and delivering working features under time-constraints

#### Business Awareness

#### Creative Solutions
 - Used Twilio (Customer SMS biz) for a weekend challenge project and immediately saw how I could adapt this for my business
 - Building an sms system that automatically messages sub-contractors essential job details as soon as they come in.
 - Automating this part of our business will help save time and cut down on disrepencies in regards to job details
